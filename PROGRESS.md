## Workflow

### Development Process

1. **One phase at a time** - Complete current phase before starting next
2. **All work on `main`** - No feature branches needed
3. **Subagents for efficiency** - Use parallel subagents within a phase for independent tasks
4. **Commit frequently** - Small, focused commits after each feature
5. **Test before moving on** - Ensure `pnpm typecheck && pnpm build` passes

### Commands

```bash
pnpm install              # Install all dependencies
pnpm dev                  # Run all apps
pnpm dev --filter crm     # Run CRM only
pnpm dev --filter web     # Run Web only
pnpm build                # Build everything
pnpm db:generate          # Generate Drizzle migrations
pnpm db:push              # Push schema to database
pnpm db:studio            # Open Drizzle Studio
pnpm lint                 # ESLint
pnpm typecheck            # TypeScript checks
pnpm test                 # Run tests
```
