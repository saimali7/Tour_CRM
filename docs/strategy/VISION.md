# Vision

> The operations platform tour companies actually want to use.

## North Star

**Make running a tour company effortless** — from first booking to final review.

## Product Principles

### 1. Operations-First
The CRM is built around how tour operators actually work: morning briefings, guide dispatch, day-of changes. Not generic CRM patterns retrofitted for tours.

### 2. Speed Over Features
A 60-second phone booking beats a 100-feature booking form. Every interaction should feel instant.

### 3. Intelligence, Not Data
Don't show dashboards of numbers. Show actionable insights: "Book 3 more guests to hit your goal" not "Revenue: $4,521".

### 4. Mobile Reality
Guides are on their feet, not at desks. The system works on phones in bright sunlight with one hand.

### 5. Multi-Tenant by Design
Every organization is isolated. No data leaks, no cross-tenant bugs, no shared-database shortcuts.

## Success Metrics

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|

## Target Users

1. **Tour Operators** — Small to mid-size companies (5-50 tours/day)
2. **Office Staff** — Booking agents, customer service
3. **Guides** — Field workers needing manifests and updates
4. **Owners** — Business intelligence and reporting

## Non-Goals
